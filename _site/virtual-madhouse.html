<p>I have been to a few other virtual days like today since graduating the course (including an introduction to SCRUM from Generation and the NetZero Skills Summit sponsored by the National Grid) but this was by far the fastest paced out of the and also included the most new technology out of them! There were 3 streams of talks to choose from and other than a CI/CD session on the Enterprise Architect stream, all of my selections were for the Building Applications stream.</p>

<p>The day jumped straight in with the many benefits of MAD in the opening Keynotes and then I tuned in for the deep dive on developer tools. This started by going over the innovation flywheel of making an iteration, experimenting with it, listening to the feedback and repeat (what other way is there?)</p>
