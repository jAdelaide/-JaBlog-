## Welcome to the first blog post I ever wrote!


Whatitdo fellow peeps, it's your favourite Jordan here with an exciting new development of the main timeline!



I just started getting into computing a couple of months ago and undertook a course ranging from Linux fundamentals to performing SysAdmin duties to coding programs in Python to using Amazon Web Services (plus a secret ingredient or two to add that extra something something that really makes the special sauce bang) and now it's over and I'm preparing for my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam (plus the rest of my career), I figured I'd put some of my skills to the test and start a lil' dev blog.


I'm not yet sure what either of us should expect to come out of this, I should probably have a look at a couple of other people's blogs tbh but who know's when I'll remember to do that so just stay strapped to your seat, prepare for anything and please try to be entertained (by the way I say things at least if not by the content itself)!!



See you on the flipside,

Â¡JaBlog!
