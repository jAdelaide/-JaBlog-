## As I hope you can tell, I have finally gotten around to learning some web development and have gotten pretty good with CSS over this past week if I do say so myself (did you hit that toggle ^ and see the transition to my high readability/dark mode yet?).


After quite a bit of research into the various languages and softwares for web development, watching videos to get a feel for what you can achieve with each, what they're generally used for, how commonly they're used in the businesses that I want to hire me etc, I decided that CSS would be the best language for me to start with and it just so happened that CSS was exactly what the template for this blog was made with! Pretty lucky there as it meant that I already had a nice, functional website that I could play with and really start understanding what various elements of it do just by going through what I already had and I didn't have to make a new website from scratch. It's actually been really fun to just get stuck in with it, hasn't been so great for my sleeping pattern or cooking proper meals as I've typically been so completely absorbed by whatever task was at hand that by the time I realise that I'm hungry, I am HUNGRY
