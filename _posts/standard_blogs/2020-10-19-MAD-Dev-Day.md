## Despite graduating from the course and passing my AWS certification, I have still barely scratched the surface of the tech world and, even if I hadn't, this world progresses so quickly that even when you do reach a high level you need to keep moving to not be left behind. Luckily, especially in the midsts of Covid-19, there are many virtual events to help you progress and stay up to date. This post is about the one today: Modern Application Development by Amazon Web Services!

I have been to a few other virtual days like today since graduating the course (including an introduction to SCRUM from Generation and the NetZero Skills Summit sponsored by the National Grid) but this was by far the fastest paced out of the and also included the most new technology out of them! There were 3 streams of talks to choose from and other than a CI/CD session on the Enterprise Architect stream, all of my selections were for the Building Applications stream.

The day jumped straight in with the many benefits of MAD in the opening Keynotes and then I tuned in for the deep dive on developer tools. This started by going over the innovation flywheel of making an iteration, experimenting with it, listening to the feedback and repeat (is there any another way to write code that works?), and then plunged right down into the Tracer from Lambda Powertools: a way to find bugs and inefficiencies in Python code by working with AWS X-Ray to provide visibility into function calls, interactions with other services and external requests. The programs I've written so far are all pretty short and even they can be hard to go through and find bugs manually so I can definitely see the use of tools like this and Code Guru, which was also briefly covered, when you're dealing with applications that can span MANY more lines of code or you have several micro-services to look through because all you know is that there's an error somewhere... The key takeaway from this session was that being a developer is fun but looking for errors isn't, so make the most of the tools available to do more of what you enjoy and less of what you don't!!
