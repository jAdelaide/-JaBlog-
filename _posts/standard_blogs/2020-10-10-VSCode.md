Now I've finished the Generation course and passed my AWS exam, I have no deadlines or anything specific that I have to do for a set time and, as I'm still pretty new to coding and am just trying to climb out of the lower levels, I figured now would be a great time to get familiar with an IDE to make my progression through the next stages that much easier and I've got to say that, even after just going through the introductory interactive playground and writing this (the first thing I've done in VSCode), I can see it being a huge help and stopping me making many small mistakes that would waste a lot of my time and energy trying to pick out myself.
