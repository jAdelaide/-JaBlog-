## I know that I ended the last blog heavily suggesting that the next would be about the development of the blog and I know what you're thinking: it's all lies, they're not even square!!! But we were just notified yesterday by the Generation course I recently completed about an hour long 'Examples of a Well-Architected Framework' masterclass this morning from an AWS solutions architect so here's a lil' blog about it!

The main point that was echoed throughout this session was "just read the whitepapers" if you're going to be involved with the framework: from the people giving the requirements to the people building it and everyone in-between or who's involved in any of the meeting regarding it. They're (apparently) written to be nice to read and also contain links and things that will help you gain the knowledge required to make informed decisions about your framework that could be the difference that saves you a lot of time and money in the long run.

There are 5 pillars to the Well-Architected Framework which are the areas it will ensure your infrastructure is strong in if you follow the advice properly, and these are operational excellence, security, reliability, performance efficiency and cost optimisation. I'm not really going to talk anymore about these as concepts as it's all stuff I became familiar with for my AWS qualification, if you want to know more then click the description in the sidebar, but the main benefits are:

- It makes it easy to evolve and maintain the infrastructure in the future
- It's secure and will help you meet compliance requirements
  - use [AWS Artifact](https://aws.amazon.com/artifact/) for access and help regarding these
- It will allow you to robustly handle failure and continue providing for your customers
  - everything fails at some point, you may as well design it to bounce back quickly
- It will help you perform well and deliver a better experience to your customers
- It will help your infrastructure provide you the best value for your money

There's also a free Well-Architected tool available on AWS that makes it easy to go through and evaluate your existing framework, meaning that you don't need to be an expert or hire one to do it for you!

The bulk of this session was actually going over what actually happens in a business meeting to review the framework. This was broken down into the 3 steps as follows:

### this is three
#### this is four
