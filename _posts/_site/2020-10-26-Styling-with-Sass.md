## As I hope you can tell, I have finally gotten around to learning some web development and have gotten pretty good with CSS (using Sass) over this past week if I do say so myself (did you hit that toggle in the header and see the transition to my high readability/dark mode yet?).


After quite a bit of research into the various languages and softwares for web development, watching videos to get a feel for what you can achieve with each, what they're generally used for, how commonly they're used in the businesses that I want to hire me etc, I decided that CSS would be the best language for me to start with and it just so happened that CSS was exactly what the template for this blog was made with! Pretty lucky there as it meant that I already had a nice, functional website that I could play with and really start understanding what various elements of it do just by going through what I already had and I didn't have to make a new website from scratch. It's actually been really fun to just get stuck in with it, hasn't been so great for my sleeping pattern or cooking proper meals as I've typically been so completely absorbed by whatever task was at hand that by the time I realise that I'm hungry, I am HUNGRY and don't particularly fancy the wait time until what I'd planned to eat was all chopped and cooked and I'm actually quite hungry right now so I'm gonna stop talking about food and get on with what this post is about.

To really make the most out of what I could learn with this blog, I wanted to customise as much of it as I could think to, starting with the colour scheme. This actually lead into much longer searching for and editing photos than I'd like to admit, this wave background was like the third picture I chose for the background of the header (before I decided it was a bit much and just went for a solid colour header) and this must be at least the 5th "finished" edit of it, the first 3 were actually the other way up. Once I'd finally settled on the image and reduced it's saturation enough that you could actually read the text over it, I had to position it. This turned out to be significantly harder than expected with the `height` and `width` parameters as the dimension ratio of the image
