<p>Now I’ve finished the Generation course and passed my AWS exam, I have no deadlines or anything specific that I have to do for a set time and, as I’m still pretty new to coding and am just trying to climb out of the lower levels, I figured now would be a great time to get familiar with an IDE to make my progression through the next stages that much easier and I’ve got to say, even after just going through the introductory interactive playground and writing this (the first thing I’ve done in VSCode), that I can see it being a huge help and stopping me making many small mistakes that would waste a lot of my time and energy trying to pick out myself in the regular terminal.</p>

<p>I chose Visual Studio Code simply because I’ve heard a few good things, a number of the coding videos I have seen have been done using it and I haven’t really heard much about any others but I am really enjoying it so far; my next project is building some form of game with the Pygame module and it is going to be a whole lot easier with the range of extensions (a couple of which I’ve already installed), as well as the standard VSCode benefits!</p>
