<p>Whatitdo fellow peeps, itâ€™s your favourite Jordan here with an exciting new development of the main timeline!</p>

<p>I just started getting into computing a couple of months ago and undertook a course ranging from Linux fundamentals to performing SysAdmin duties to coding programs in Python to using Amazon Web Services (plus a secret ingredient or two to add that extra something something that really makes the special sauce bang) and now itâ€™s over and Iâ€™m preparing for my AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner exam (plus the rest of my career), I figured Iâ€™d put some of my skills to the test and start a lilâ€™ dev blog.</p>

<p>Iâ€™m not yet sure what either of us should expect to come out of this, I should probably have a look at a couple of other peopleâ€™s blogs tbh but who knowâ€™s when Iâ€™ll remember to do that so just stay strapped to your seat, prepare for anything and please try to be entertained (by the way I say things at least if not by the content itself)!!</p>

<p>See you on the flipside,</p>
