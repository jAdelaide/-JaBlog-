<p>After several days of procrastination and starting other projects I finally got round to finishing the Giraffe Academy tutorial videos for setting up a static site and Iâ€™ve gotta say, it ainâ€™t at all half shabby!</p>

<p>With the completion of the set up of the blog, it has suddenly dawned on me that Iâ€™ve given no thought to what Iâ€™m going to blog about, how regularly I want to do it, if I want to change the layout or style of the blog further etcâ€¦ I guess weâ€™ll see what comes, Iâ€™ll try to write blogs about any projects I do end up undertaking but who knows if Iâ€™ll even know what to say then! Iâ€™ve also just realised how accustomed Iâ€™ve become to excessively using the under pressure, smiling, sweating emoji guy so maybe Iâ€™ll figure out how to get emojis on here at some point (thinking face emoji).</p>
