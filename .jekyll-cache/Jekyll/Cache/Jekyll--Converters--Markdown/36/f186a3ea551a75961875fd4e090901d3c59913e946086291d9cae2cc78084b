Luckily, especially in the midsts of Covid, there are many virtual events to help you progress and stay up to date. This post is about the one today: Modern Application Development by Amazon Web Services!</h2>

<p>I have been to a few other virtual days like today since graduating the course (including an introduction to SCRUM from Generation and the NetZero Skills Summit sponsored by the National Grid) but this was by far the fastest paced out of the and also included the most new technology out of them!</p>
